The aim of this report is to discuss results presented in ['Word translation without parallel data'](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04087.pdf) by A. Conneau, G. Lample, M. Ranzato, L. Denoyer and H. Jegou. This notice is a part of a neural network class project. The report consists of two parts. First, we answer question raised by our teacher. Then, we give a summary of our efforts to reproduce results claimed by the authors.
